3 stages:
modified , staged , commit :

if you modify content after a commit it gets in the modified area
to put them in the staged area, use : 
    git add <file name>
to remove from staged :
    git rm --cached <file name>
to see status if the files:
    git status
to commit:
    git commit -m <message in quotes>
to see the commits:
    git log --oneline

if you make mistakes and want to go back:
revert , reset
